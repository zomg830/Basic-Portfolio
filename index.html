    <p>My name is Matt Faubel, I'm currently an amateur web designer based out of Austin, TX.
       This is the first step I'm taking into an exciting new step in my life. Throughout the 
       next few weeks I will be updating this portfolio page and my GitHub repository with many
       different types of coding projects. This will certainly be one of the most difficult 
       undertakings I have embarked on, but I'm excited to share my progress and my journey!
       <br>
       <br>
       I've always believed that financial independence should be a goal for everyone, and to 
       further that goal I want to be able to have the freedom to separate my source of income 
       from my place of residence. Under the 'Additional Links' tab I've added my preferred sites
       to find financial news and stock prices.
       <br>
       <br>
       Throughout the next six months I will be taking a full-stack flex (i.e., part-time) coding
       course at the University of Texas. I hope to learn more about front-end technologies (HMTL
       and CSS, of course) as well as the back-end technologies that help make the Internet function
       as we know it.
