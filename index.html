    <p>My name is Matt Faubel, I'm currently an amateur web designer based out of Austin, TX.
       This is the first step I'm taking into an exciting new step in my life. Throughout the 
       next few weeks I will be updating this portfolio page and my GitHub repository with many
       different types of coding projects. 
       <br>
       <br>
       I've always believed that financial independence should be a goal for everyone. For the 
       uninitiated Financially Independent (FI), means not having to work for money. Financial Independence
       is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early (RE) - quitting your job/career
       and pursuing other activities with your time. Under the 'Additional Links' tab I've added
       my preferred sites to find financial news and stock prices.
       <br>
       <br>
       Throughout the next six months I will be taking a full-stack flex (i.e., part-time) coding
       course through The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin. I hope to learn more about front-end technologies (HMTL
       and CSS, of course) as well as the back-end technologies that help make the Internet function
       as we know it.
