    <p>My name is Matt Faubel, I'm currently an amateur web designer based out of Austin, TX.
       This is the first step I'm taking into an exciting new step in my life. Throughout the 
       next few weeks I will be updating this portfolio page and my GitHub repository with many
       different types of coding projects. This will certainly be one of the most difficult 
       undertakings I have embarked on, but I'm excited to share my progress and my journey!
